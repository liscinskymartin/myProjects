## Problem
Users are unable to see a global overview of mobile project customization, especially the settings of entities. It is challenging and time-consuming to identify problems with the customization. The goal is to have a tool that will provide an overview of used entities. Additionally, it would be nice to provide a graphical visualization of relations between entities.

## Solution
The Data Model Explorer offers an overview of the entities used in your app project. At a glance, you can identify large tables with many columns and review their conflict resolution or synchronization strategies.
